                The Computer Science Department conducts both an undergraduate and a graduate program in 
                Computer Science. The undergraduate program offers a dynamic curriculum with a strong emphasis 
                on software design. Students navigate the intricacies of their project-oriented coursework as 
                they learn to design, build, and implement computer software from the ground up. 
                <br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The program provides an extensive background in computer programming languages, computer architecture, and the 
                design and application of computer algorithms. Progress through this diverse curriculum leads to 
                concentrated instruction on topics such as Cyber Security and Operations, cloud computing, mobile computing, 
                software entrepreneurship, wireless communication networks, machine learning, data mining, high performance 
                computing, robotics, human computer interaction, 3D game programming, and data science. 
                <br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Please see the elective courses we offer here based on different career interests.
                The department's Bachelor of Science program has been fully 
                accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET since 1994. For 
                further information visit the Program Accreditation & Assessment page.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education goal of this lab is to develop and implement a well-balanced 
                    curriculum in information assurance, security and forensics based on ACM Computer 
                    Science Curriculum 2013 and NSA/CSS Cyber Ops program. Research activities focus 
                    on cognitive cyber securty solutions based on psychology, physiology and neuroscience 
                    as well as assessing and addressing security vulnerabilities in emerging technologies. 
                    CPP has been designated as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information 
                    Assurance/Cyber Defense (CAE-IA/CD) Education for academic years 2014-2021 by NSA/DHS. 
                    We have received an NSF Cyber Corps Scholarship for Service grant from 2015-2021 to support 
                    our cyber security students and train them to protect critical national infrastructure from 
                    cyber threats. We are also supported by many other corporations and national labs.
